## Description

This file has different files with each file offering a solution to the challenges provided in week 1's toy problems. A more detailed description per challange will be found below.


### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
The studentgradegenerator.js file contains a function that gives grades from A to E based on the marks input. The function accepts one argument which is the marks.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
The solution to this challenge is in the speeddetector.js file. It contains a function that takes the argument of speed and based on it, checks whether the driver was overspeeding. For every 5km/h above the speed limit, the driver gets a demerit point.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
The netsalarycalculator.js file has some expansive code calculating the tax deductions, gross and net salary of an individual. The function takes two arguments, the basic salary and benefits. The function is divided into different sections to accommodate the deductions that have to be made based on the basic salary input.
